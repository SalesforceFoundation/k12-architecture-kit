# K-12 Architecture Kit

The Salesforce K-12 Architecture Kit provides a K-12 education-specific platform for growth for organizations utilizing Salesforce. K-12 Architecture Kit adds unmanaged meta data to Salesforce's Education Data Architecture (EDA) managed package to give K-12 Educational Institution users a familiar nomenclature and data model for many education applications. In addition, Education developers and administrators can utilize EDA's advanced trigger management capabilities, robust error handling and pluggable framework to better manage and coordinate the data in their Salesforce instance.

K-12 Architecture Kit is built from industry-wide best practices used across education institutions and the Salesforce ecosystem and we welcome feedback and contributions for the project. See below for more information on how to get involved.
