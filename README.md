# K-12 Architecture Kit

K-12 Architecture Kit from Salesforce.org provides an education-specific platform for K-12 educational institutions building out a CRM. K-12 Architecture Kit adds unmanaged metadata to Salesforce's Education Data Architecture (EDA) managed package to give K-12 educational institution users a familiar nomenclature and data model for common education applications. Also, education developers and administrators can use EDA's advanced trigger management capabilities, robust error handling, and extensible framework to better manage and coordinate their data in Salesforce.

K-12 Architecture Kit is built upon industry-wide best practices from across educational institutions and the Salesforce ecosystem. We welcome your feedback and contributions to K-12 Architecture Kit.
